Dear Sir:


Re: Second review for your Canada Recovery Benefit application


We are writing to advise you of our decision regarding your request dated September 9, 2021, for a second review of your Canada Recovery Benefit (CRB) application.

We have completed your request and have carefully considered all the information to support your CRB eligibility.

Based on our review, you are not eligible.

You did not meet the following criteria:

You did not have a 50% reduction in your average weekly income compared to the previous year due to COVID-19.


As you did not meet the eligibility criteria to qualify for CRB, any future CRB applications will be denied unless you can provide proof that you are able to satisfy the eligibility criteria.

If you received a CRB payment that you were not eligible for, you will be required to repay the amount.

For more information on how to make a repayment, go to canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/benefits/recovery-benefit/crb-return-payment.html.

If you disagree with the result of the second review, you may apply to the Federal Court for a judicial review within 30 days of the date of this letter. For more information on judicial reviews, go to canada.ca/cra-judicial-review.


Yours sincerely,

Donna Boivin
Manager
Canada Emergency Benefits Validation
