Dear Sir:


Re: Second review for your Canada Recovery Sickness Benefit application

We are writing to advise you of our decision regarding your request dated September 22, 2021, for a second review of your Canada Recovery Sickness Benefit (CRSB) application.

We have completed your request and have carefully considered all the information to support your CRSB eligibility.

Based on our review, you are not eligible.

You did not meet the following criteria:

Your scheduled work week was not reduced by at least 50% because you were self-isolating for reasons related to COVID-19.
You received Employment Insurance (EI) benefits for the same period.
You were not employed or self-employed on the day before your first application period.


As you did not meet the eligibility criteria to qualify for CRSB, any future CRSB applications will be denied unless you can provide proof that you are able to satisfy the eligibility criteria.

If you received a CRSB payment that you were not eligible for, you will be required to repay the amount.

For more information on how to make a repayment, go to canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/benefits/recovery-sickness-benefit/crsb-return-payment.html.

If you disagree with the result of the second review, you may apply to the Federal Court for a judicial review within 30 days of the date of this letter. For more information on judicial reviews, go to canada.ca/cra-judicial-review.


Yours sincerely,

Donna Boivin
