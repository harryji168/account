Thank you for using NETFILE, YINGXU RONG. The Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) has successfully received and processed your 2021 tax return. Planned for 2023, the CRA will start the process of switching to providing a notice of assessment or reassessment electronically. At which time, you will need to be registered for My Account, when filing your return using NETFILE in order to receive your notice of assessment electronically. Once registered for My Account, you will retrieve your notice of assessment through your NETFILE software when providing an email address or directly through My Account. You can find more information on how to register for My Account here: Registration process to access the CRA sign-in services. Note: First-time filers may receive a notice of assessment by mail. You must keep all tax information slips and documents for six years after you filed the tax return.
